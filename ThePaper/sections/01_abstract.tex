% SONIC is an identity management protocol that allows to have a unique user social profile and to migrate it between different online social networks (OSN). Sonic relies on a distributed system called Global Social Lookup System. GSLS can be seen as a service mapping a user gloabal identity to its social profiles. Is open source and based on a distributed hash table (DHT) to handle communication and persistence. This implementation and its openness carries a list of security issue. The aim of this project is to overcome this issues by exploiting the characteristic of blockchain. Blockchain is distributed ledger bla bla... and can provide both storage and validation features. 
% % In order to do so we research the state of the art regarding identity management and blockchain. 
% We describe some of the security issues related to the current implementation of GSLS; design a service to manage self-asserted identities in a blockchain. The new system is then evaluated in terms of performance, security, privacy and invasiveness for the user.
