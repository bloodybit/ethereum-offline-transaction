\subsection{Blockstack as an example of blockchain utilization in Open Source enviroment}
Blockstack is a particular implementation of a decentralized DNS system based on blockchain. It combines DNS functionality with public key infrastructure and is primarily meant to be used by new blockchain applications.

According to the company: \enquote{under the hood, Blockstack provides a decentralized domain name system (DNS), decentralized public key distribution system, and registry for apps and user identities} \cite{BlockStackMainPage}.

The real breakthrough is the architecture the system is built on. It can be described as a three-layer design with the blockchain as the first and lower tier, the storage system as the upper and the peer network as middle layer.
