Background OSNs, they use Sonic as a protocol and Sonic relies on a distributed system called Global Social Lookup System. The GSLS can be seen as a service mapping user identity with user social profiles. It is completely open source and based on a Distributed Hash Table to handle communication and persistence. This implementation and the openness bears a list of security issues. The aim of this project is to overcome this issues by exploiting the characteristic of blockchain. Blockchain is distributed ledger bla bla... and can provide both storage and validation features. In order to do so we research the state of the art regarding identity management and blockchain. We describe some of the security issues related to the current implementation of the GSLS; conceptualize and design a service to manage self-asserted identities in a blockchain. The new system is then evaluated in terms of performance, security and invasivity for the user.
