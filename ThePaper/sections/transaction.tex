The identified solution is to replace the DHT layer with the blockchain technology, in particular Ethereum.

\begin{notation}
  TODO: \\
  Explain why ethereum and make comaprison with bitcoin (simply: bitcoin is expensive and non optimazed for key value. Other blockchain are not safe => bigchaindb or not yet fully developed => Lisk).

  Other blockchain are not worth to be mention for lack of documentation.

  How to explain this without sources if not the persona experience??
\end{notation}
The main reasons we choose this approach are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistent storage by definition. Ethereum blockchain creates different replicas of the same database in each node of the network. With such solution, nodes can enter or exit the network without compromising any social record.
  \item In case of failure, it is possible to recover the state of the database and re-execute the missing transactions.
  \item Ethereum is a distributed ledger, it is not possible to forge part of the database (at least 50\% + 1 of the nodes must be corrupted). Preventing any node to send misleading social records.
  \item One of the main features of the blockchain is the endless scalability: this permits to set up a high number of nodes (multiple GSLS servers per each OSN and the users who are willing to set up one node) without facing any delay.
  Even better, increasing the size of the network and therefore the difficulty of a rewrite attack (50\% + number of nodes).
  \item Hosting one node allows to locally access the social records stored into the GSLS storage. In the previous implementation (with DHT) it was possible that one specific social record was only available in nodes far away from the requesting resource, creating a delay in the delivery of the information. 
\end{itemize}

Given these premises, Ethereum blockchain seems to be the tool for the job: providing a consistent, distribute and scalable and environment; accessible by all the player at the same time.



\subsubsection{Serializability of the Ethereum Transaction}
