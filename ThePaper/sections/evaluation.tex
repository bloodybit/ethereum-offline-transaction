\subsection{Security}

\subsubsection{In compare with the previous GSLS}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Now data are sent in an encrypted way - Communication channel is secure
  \item Data are 'more distributed' not only in the GSLS network but over all the nodes 
  \item Not possible to create replication/replay attack (or whatever is called, where you basically repeat the same instruction)
  \item Built in versioning system
  \item Nonce problem (one node could always return a wrong nonce), change the GSLS server
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{In compare with light client}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is a light client, just very light, it allows only few operations (not possible to hack it with other transactions if not the one we wrote in the abi file ) <-- confirm that
  \item All the security of a cold wallet (no 3rd party knows it), but still able to create transactions
  \item No need to install particular and specific blockchain nodes or to run any particular program in background. The Identity management over the Social Networks is a service widely used by the majority of the developed countries therefore must be easy to use and plug & play. [in our case you register as if a normal website -> with the same complexity for the user]
\end{itemize}
