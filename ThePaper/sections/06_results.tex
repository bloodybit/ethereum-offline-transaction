\section{Results and Analysis}
\label{S:5}


% \subsection{Security}

% \subsubsection{In compare with the previous GSLS}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Now data are sent in an encrypted way - Communication channel is secure
%   \item Data are "more distributed" not only in the GSLS network but over all the nodes
%   \item Not possible to create replication/replay attack (or whatever is called, where you basically repeat the same instruction)
%   \item Built in versioning system
%   \item Nonce problem (one node could always return a wrong nonce), change the GSLS server
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{In compare with light client}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item This is a light client, just very light, it allows only few operations (not possible to hack it with other transactions if not the one we wrote in the abi file ) <-- confirm that
%   \item All the security of a cold wallet (no 3rd party knows it), but still able to create transactions.
%   \item No need to install particular and specific blockchain nodes or to run any particular program in background. The Identity management over the Social Networks is a service widely used by the majority of the developed countries therefore must be easy to use and plug & play. [in our case you register as if a normal website -> with the same complexity for the user]
% \end{itemize}


In this implementation, the GSLS becomes an Ethereum node which proxies the user requests to the Ethereum node itself.
The users must download a desktop application (or can build the transaction by themselves). Is recommendable that this process is carried out offline: in order to avoid attacks.

\subsection{Solidity data structures}
Solidity is the name of the Ethereum contract language. It is designed to optimize the efficiency and memory of the EVM and, for these reasons, it does not allow arrays with undefined length.
The only solution to this issue is to map types in a key-value fashion.

One data structure is requires to map the sender address with its own \textit{globalId} (the user unique identifier for the OSN).  To increase the reading performance, another mapping has been designed: from \textit{globalId} to \textit{socialRecord} information.

This approach might be criticized because it implements one more data structure: especially considering that the storage increase exponentially with the number of nodes but, nevertheless justified by the fact of having an iterable map requires the same additional data structure by definition as in \cite{datastructure_solidity}.

  Should we add image or table with the data structures?

\subsection{Write operation}
The user must create or own a \textit{key pair} (public \& private key) on the client side (See Electron desktop application in the appendix).
In order to create a new transaction, the sender must know his \textit{nonce}, the current \textit{gasPrice} and the \textit{gasLimit}. This values are available to any node, therefore the desktop application sends a get request to the GSLS along with its account address. Once all the fields are known to the sender, she signs it with its private key, encode it via RLP and send to the GSLS server.
