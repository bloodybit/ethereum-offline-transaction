	shorttitle = {{SONIC}},
	abstract = {Online Social Networks ({OSNs}) have become an important part of our everyday online lives. We communicate, share content, and organize meetings and events using {OSN} platforms. However, even though there is a strong trend towards {OSN} services to become the main communication medium, most {OSN} platforms are still proprietary, closed services that keep users from connecting directly and seamlessly to the services of other {OSN} platforms. The resulting lock-in effects are intentionally created by {OSN} operators, as their business models are built mostly on targeted advertisement services. We envision a truly open and decentralized ecosystem of {OSN} platforms, where users are not cut off from friends using other social platforms and can freely migrate from one {OSN} platform to another at any time without losing established relationships in the social graph. This would allow users to freely choose an {OSN} platform of their liking instead of being limited in their choice to the platform used by one's friends. In this paper, we give an overview about the issues addressed within the research project {SONIC} and present the architectural requirements as well as the architectural concepts of the proposed solution. The project proposes an decentralized and heterogeneous federation of {OSN} platforms connected via a communication protocol that allows different {OSN} platforms to seamlessly communicate with each other and gives users the ability to migrate social profiles between platforms on demand.},
